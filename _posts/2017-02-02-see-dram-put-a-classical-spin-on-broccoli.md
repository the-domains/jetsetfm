  If you turned on the radio at least once in 2016, you probably heard
  "Broccoli," D.R.A.M. 's chirpy, carefree collaboration with Lil Yachty. The
  song went double platinum, topped the Billboard charts, and is even up for a
  Grammy Award this month, but that doesn't mean D.R.A.M.'s afraid to revise the
  formula and put a different spin on his much-loved hit.
